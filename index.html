      <p class="intro">Food insecurity has been a relevant and challenging issue for many in the U.S. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that a total of 10.5% of American households were food insecure in 2019. A total of 13.7 million
        households were food insecure at some point in 2019. That number was down from 11.1% in 2018.
      </p>
      <p> Still in some parts of the U.S., such as New York City, there has been both a decrease and increase. Throughout the five boroughs from 2015 to 2019, there has been a steady increase in the Bronx and Manhattan.

          <p class="graphic-text">Staten Island, Queens, and Brooklyn have all seen a negative average percent change in the last 5 years. In 2015, Staten Island had a food insecurity rate of 10.6%, but in 2019 it decreased down to 8.3%.
            Similarly, Queens had a significant drop after having a 19.8% rate in 2015 to 10.5% in 2019, an average percent change of -41%. But the Bronx and Manhattan have seen a positive average percent change within the last five years.
            <p2> The recent COVID-19 pandemic will most likely cause an increase in all numbers across the five boroughs, but still these numbers show a trend in the Bronx and Manhattan. While the other boroughs are showing decreases, these two are
              seeing food insecurity numbers rise.
